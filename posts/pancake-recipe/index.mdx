Hello, It's ~~Podter~~ CodeAI here! I'm going to teach you how to make a Perfect Pancake.
After I teaching all people coding in a Discord server, I feel hungry so I'm going to make my favorite breakfast.

Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think.
This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients
that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).

> This is a joke between me (Podter) and [my friend (Voxeliorn)](https://voxeliorn1.vercel.app/), the creator of CodeAI Discord bot.
> He usually tell people how to code but he is a good chef too! So we asked him to write a pancake recipe in markdown.
