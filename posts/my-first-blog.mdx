This is my very first blog on podter.xyz! I don't know what to talk about yet. But I want to test my brand new blog page with page counter,
so I'm going to talk about How I write my blogs. (and idk why)

## How I write my blog

I write blog using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). I can write blog in Markdown language and I can add JSX components here.

MDX files will be processed using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/).
This will generate some JSON files in `.contentlayer` and can be generate to static site (SSG) using front-end framework like Next.js

I also added a MDX Plugin. It's `remark-gfm`! It's a plugin that allow me to write in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) or GFM (autolink literals, footnotes, strikethrough, tables, tasklists).

That's it! I don't know what to talk about yet, maybe I will make another blog about this separately. You can see my MDX blog files on [here](https://github.com/Podter/podter.xyz/tree/main/posts).
Or if you want to learn how I did this then you can check out my website source code [here](https://github.com/Podter/podter.xyz/tree/main/posts).
