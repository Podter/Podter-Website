    Hey, I'm Podter. Some folks call me Pod. I'm a student and self-taught
    developer from Thailand. I like playing games and listening to music. I
    enjoy web development and Linux stuff.

  <TypographyP>
    I'm currently trying to manage my life between school and playing games. I'm
    also working on a few projects in my free time.
