<H1 className="mt-0">About</H1>

Hey, I'm <U>Podter</U>. Some folks call me <U>Pod</U> for short. I'm a student and self-taught
developer from Thailand. I like playing games and listening to music. I enjoy
web development and Linux stuff.

I'm currently trying to manage my life between school and playing games.
I'm also working on a few projects in my free time.

I enjoy computer stuff since I was young. It was fun back then.
I started learning Lua (or Luau) in Roblox Studio. It was my first programming language and
I made a few games and scripts just for fun. Then I started learning JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
I also learned a bit of C# and Dart with Flutter. Look like enjoy using TypeScript for most of my stuff.

Sometime I mess around with Linux or OS stuff. Trying out different distros in VMs,
setting up my own server, self-hosting, Docker, and stuff like that.

If I'm not coding then I'm probably playing games or watching something.
I like playing indie games and adventure games. I also enjoy watching
[South Park](https://www.southparkstudios.com) and [Bluey](https://www.bluey.tv).
