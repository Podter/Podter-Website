# About me

Hey, I'm **Podter**. You can call me just **Pod** for short. Sometimes I call myself **Potter**.

I'm a **student** and **self-taught developer**. I come from Thailand and English is my secondary language.
Sometimes I play games like Roblox, Minecraft or anything else. Or maybe spending my time chatting in Discord and listening to musics.

I love playing with computers since I was **6 years old**! Now I **love** coding or making some projects in
my free time or hobby. Or playing around with Linux servers and VMs. I **usually** start a project
with Vite and PocketBase as backend, all the way to large Node.js applications and containerized with Docker.

## My skills

I started coding since I was **12 years old**. My first programming language was **Lua** (or Luau) in Roblox Studio.
Lua is the easiest language to learn or getting started. And then **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**
for building Discord bot (Cozmo bot). Now I'm stuck here forever because good ecosystem like npm packages.

**This is what can I do:**
